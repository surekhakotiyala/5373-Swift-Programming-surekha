Abstract

Peer to peer files sharing via mobile devices has introduced several discussions and challenges with various technologies
and methods in today’s mobile territory. This paper describes the variety of ways to utilize the peer to peer networks
which caused an increase of mobile devices with security. The evolution has started from Internet connection alloted by 
traditional mobile cellular telecommunication networks to free Internet connection through Wi-Fi technology, further 
extended by using blue-tooth. However, smart phones are assumed to be equipped with a zigbee modem for allotting control 
functionality for personal wireless sensor networks. Furthermore, a systematic review with various approaches like
unstructured and structured P2P system, mobile-to-mobile technique, tree-structured based, and incentive are discussed.
Besides, it takes a look on the system stability when frequent disconnections occur and on different types of applications that are
used for sharing the files with less delay time. This prevents the bandwidth from duplicate traffic and overhead signals.
Moreover, for rapid development of the mobile peer to peer communications hierarchical architecture is developed. 
This architecture uses clustering for obtaining peer communications with three main aspects like maximum 
connection time, minimum hop count and number of connected peers. These connections between the peers are intent by their
communication ranges, velocity vector and also by their locations. Hence, the network between the peers will be stable 
and cost is reduced with good success in content searching. Security and privacy also plays an important role while sharing files between trusted and untrusted networks like Wi-fi and Blue-tooth. For 
flexible and power efficient mechanisms a system is developed, which is known as Smokescreen. This system broadcasts 
clique signals which can accessed only by trusted users that is sharing between social relations and on other side some 
opaque identifiers are used for trusted broker that is sharing between strangers.
